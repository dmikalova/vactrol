// Restriction effects forbid a player some action for a stretch of the game,
// rather than changing the board directly. A "cannot" rule can arrive two ways:
// as a timed effect (this file) or as a constant rule printed on a card in play
// (CardDefinition.Restricts). Both feed the same gates (Game.cannotFight,
// Game.cannotPlayCreatures), so the restriction is expressed once and honored the
// same way however it is imposed.

// CannotFight bars a player from using creatures to fight. As an effect it is a
// timed bar — Fogbank stops an opponent for the Duration of their next turn. The
// same bar can be printed on a card as a constant Restrictions.Fighting rule; the
// fight gate consults both.

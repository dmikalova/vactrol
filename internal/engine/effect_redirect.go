// RedirectFightDamage is a "Before Fight" effect: the controller chooses a
// creature (its Target), and the attacker deals its own fight damage to that
// creature instead of to the creature it is fighting (Gabos Longarms). It only
// redirects the attacker's outgoing fight damage — the attacker still takes
// damage back from the creature it fights. The chosen creature is stored on the
// game state for the fight in progress; the combat step reads and clears it.

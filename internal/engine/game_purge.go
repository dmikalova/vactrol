// This file holds the purge pile: cards set aside out of the game. Purging pulls
// a card from a discard pile into its owner's purge pile, from which nothing in
// the base game returns — so purge is the game's way of permanently answering
// recursion out of the discard.

// purgeFromDiscard moves a card from a player's discard pile to their purge pile.
// Callers pass a card already in that discard pile.

// pass a card already in that hand.

// Resolver is the complete interface an effect uses to inspect and change the
// game. Effects hold only a Resolver (through EffectContext) — never the *Game or
// its GameState — so every change a card is able to make goes through one of
// these methods. The list below is therefore the full, explicit catalogue of
// what an effect is allowed to do; *Game implements it. The surface is
// deliberately wide: each new mechanic adds a method here, which surfaces the
// engine's effect-facing capability (and any gaps worth refactoring) in one place.

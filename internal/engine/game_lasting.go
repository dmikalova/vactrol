// This file holds LASTING EFFECTS: "for the remainder of the turn" effects that
// attach to a later game event. Two flavors share the same flat registry:
//
//   - a REACTION runs after an event (Full Moon gains Æmber after you play a
//     creature, Charge! deals damage after you play a creature, Crystal Hive gains
//     Æmber after a creature reaps). Reactions are fired by fireLasting, which
//     gathers every reaction responding to an event and lets the controller order
//     them when several fire at once.
//   - a REPLACEMENT changes an event's own outcome before it happens (Dimension
//     Door makes reaping steal Æmber instead of gaining it). The event site queries
//     for a replacement (lastingReplacement) and applies it in place.
//
// Because the game state is a flat, pointerless value it cannot hold effect
// closures, so a lasting effect is a small enum-tagged record (LastingEffect)
// resolved by a central switch. Adding a new one is a new Event and/or
// lastingAction plus a case here — never a bespoke branch in the play/reap path.

// Event names a moment a lasting effect attaches to.

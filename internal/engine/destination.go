// Destination names where an effect puts a card it moves — the KeyForge phrase a
// card uses, e.g. "into your hand" or "on top of your deck". The deck has three
// separate destinations (its top, its bottom, and shuffled in), so "the deck"
// alone is never a destination; a card always names which. An effect takes one to
// say where a card goes, e.g. MoveFromDiscard{Destination: ToTopOfDeck}.

// This file holds combat: an attacker fighting a defender, dealing damage (with
// armor, Skirmish, Assault, and Hazardous), and deciding which creatures the
// damage destroys. The destruction itself is carried out in game_destroy.go.

// Combat: use one of your ready creatures to fight an enemy creature. Both deal
// damage equal to their power at the same time; armor reduces the damage a
// creature takes, and a Skirmish attacker takes no damage back. A creature with
// damage equal to or greater than its power is destroyed, and both deaths are
// resolved together, so neither fighter's destruction changes the damage the
// other deals.

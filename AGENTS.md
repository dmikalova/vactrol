# AGENTS.md

Repo-wide guidance for agents. See `internal/cards/AGENTS.md` for
card-authoring specifics.

## Build, test, and lint through `mage`

Run all build/test/format/coverage tasks through `mage`, not raw `go`
commands. The targets wrap the project's conventions (engine coverage gate,
comment/rulebook generation, gofmt), so use them:

- `mage build` — build all packages.
- `mage test` — run all tests.
- `mage vet` — run `go vet`.
- `mage fmt` / `mage fmtCheck` — format, or check formatting without writing.
- `mage cover` — run engine tests and report coverage (kept at 100%).
- `mage generateComments` — rewrite each card's doc comment from its definition.
- `mage gen` — regenerate card comments and the rulebook.
- `mage check` — the full green gate (fmt-check, build, vet, test, coverage);
  run this before considering work done. It must print `ALL GREEN`.

Card research (so you never need a throwaway grep/JSON script):

- `mage lookup "<name>"` — print every source card whose name contains the
  query, with set code, collector number, house/type/rarity, printed text, and a
  ready-made `card.Provenance(...)` call.
- `mage missing <setSlug>` — list the source cards in a set not yet tagged by an
  implemented card (the cards still to implement); slugs match the files in
  `internal/cards/provenance` minus `.json` (e.g. `callofthearchons`).
- `mage coverage` — per-source-set count of cards covered by an implemented
  card's provenance Ref.

Run `mage -l` to see every target.

## Multiple agents may be running

More than one agent can be working in this repo at the same time. If the build,
vet, or tests fail because of a change you did **not** make — an unfamiliar file,
a symbol you never touched, an in-progress edit that doesn't yet compile — assume
another agent is mid-change. Wait a little and try again rather than "fixing" or
reverting their work. Only act on failures that stem from your own changes.

## Interpreting requests

Read every request through the lens of **idiomatic, maintainable, composable,
well-written Go that will keep being extended** as more of the game is
implemented. When a request is ambiguous or underspecified, choose the option a
senior Go engineer would find clearest and easiest to build on later — not merely
the shortest path to a passing build.

## Refactoring is welcome

Do **not** contort a new feature to fit the current implementation. If a mechanic
lands more cleanly after reshaping existing code — renaming, splitting, or
generalizing a type, effect, or seam — prefer the refactor. A good fit for the
new feature (and the features that will follow it) matters more than preserving
today's shape. Keep such refactors focused, keep everything green (including 100%
`internal/engine` coverage), and leave the design better than you found it.

## File organization

`internal/engine` splits by responsibility, and the filename says which:

- `game.go` + `game_*.go` — the `Game` runtime: methods on `*Game`, grouped by
  area (`game_turn.go`, `game_play.go`, `game_read.go`, `game_abilities.go`,
  `game_combat.go`, `game_leaves_play.go`, …). A new `Game` method goes in the
  matching `game_*.go`.
- `effect.go` + `effect_*.go` — the effect AST, one file per mechanic
  (`effect_aember.go`, `effect_damage.go`, …). A new effect goes in
  `effect_<mechanic>.go`.
- Everything else is a small type/data file named after the concept it defines:
  `card.go`, `state.go`, `types.go`, `target.go`, `duration.go`, `destination.go`,
  `resolver.go`, `text.go`. A new enum or value type gets its **own**
  `<concept>.go` — e.g. destinations live in `destination.go`, not
  `game_destination.go`; the `game_` prefix is only for `Game` methods.

Tests live beside their source in `<name>_test.go`. The `card` facade mirrors the
engine's namespace/type files: `duration.go` → `card/duration.go`,
`destination.go` → `card/destination.go`.

## Lasting "remainder of the turn" effects (event-driven, never hardcoded)

Some effects last "for the remainder of the turn" and attach to a later game event
— Full Moon gains Æmber whenever you play a creature, Charge! deals damage whenever
you play a creature, Crystal Hive gains Æmber whenever a creature reaps, Dimension
Door makes reaping steal instead of gain. Do **not** add a bespoke `if g.State.Foo…`
block to the play or reap path (`PlayCreature`, `reapWith`) for each of these — that
hardcodes every effect into the hot path and makes effects sharing a timing window
impossible to order. Instead, everything routes through the flat registry in
`game_lasting.go` (`AddLasting(on Event, do lastingAction, controller, amount)`).
Because the state is a flat, pointerless value it cannot hold effect closures, so a
lasting effect is a small enum-tagged record `LastingEffect{On Event, Do
lastingAction, Controller, Amount}`.

There are two flavors:

- A **reaction** runs *after* an event. The event site emits **one** dispatch —
  `g.fireLasting(EventCreaturePlayed, actor, subject)` / `g.fireLasting(EventReap,
  …)` — which gathers every reaction the actor owns for that event and, when several
  fire at once, lets the controller **order** them (KeyForge lets the active player
  order simultaneous triggers), resolving each via `resolveReaction`. So "gain Æmber
  after you play a creature" and "deal damage after you play a creature" order for
  free. Authored as `card.ForRemainderOfTurn{On: card.Event.CreaturePlayed, Do:
  card.GainAember{...}}` (Do is a small composed effect — `GainAember` or
  `DealDamage` to an enemy creature).
- A **replacement** changes an event's *own outcome* before it happens. The event
  site queries the registry (`g.lastingReplacement(player, EventReapAember)`) and
  applies the replacement in place — `gainReapAember` steals instead of gaining when
  Dimension Door is active. Authored as `card.Instead{Of: card.Event.ReapAember,
  With: card.Steal}`.

Adding a reaction on an existing event = supporting its `Do` in `lastingActionOf` +
`resolveReaction`; a new event = an `Event` value, one `fireLasting`/
`lastingReplacement` call at that site, and the `clause`/`gerund` text. You never
touch the play/reap path's structure. `EndTurn` drops a player's entries via
`clearLasting`.

## Constant-granted abilities

When a card in play says that every creature gains an ability, author it as a
`ConstantAbility` with a `Target` and `Granted` abilities. Annihilation Ritual is
the model: it grants each creature the ability that purges that creature when it
is destroyed.

```go
card.WithConstantAbility(card.ConstantAbility{
  Target: card.Target.EachCreature,
  Granted: []card.Ability{{
    Trigger: card.Trigger.Destroyed,
    Effect:  card.PurgeCreature{Target: card.Target.This},
  }},
}),
```

The engine gathers every Destroyed ability for all creatures being destroyed,
then lets the active player order them. A `PurgeCreature{Target: card.Target.This}`
ability takes its creature out of play immediately, so that creature's remaining
Destroyed abilities do not resolve and final destruction cleanup does not move it
to its discard pile. Never implement this kind of card as a global override in
`discardDestroyed` or another leave-play path.

## KeyForge vernacular

Names — types, methods, fields, effects, targets, everything — must stay within
KeyForge's own vocabulary rather than generic gaming terms. Say
`ExceptMostPowerfulCreature`, not `ExceptStrongest`; `CannotFight`, not
`PreventFight`. When you need the right word, source it in this order:

1. The **provenance files** (`internal/cards/provenance`) and the original card
   text they point at — the canonical wording.
2. **Existing implementations** in this repo — reuse an established term instead
   of coining a synonym.

If neither has a term for the concept, pick the phrasing closest to how KeyForge
cards are actually written, and flag it for the user.

## Writing abilities (card authoring)

Author cards through the `card` facade in the multiline ability style —
`card.WithAbility(` breaks onto its own line, the trigger and effect share the
next line, and each effect struct field goes on its own line when there is more
than one (single-field effects stay inline):

```go
card.WithAbility(
	card.Trigger.Play, card.CannotFight{
		Player:   card.Opponent,
		Duration: card.Duration.NextTurn,
	}),
```

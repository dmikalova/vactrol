# Concepts

This document outlines the core concepts of Vactrol, a KeyForge-style card game.

## Core Concepts

- A set is a collection of about 400 cards.
  - A set has 7 factions, each of which has a playstyle
- A deck is a collection of 36 cards, drawn from a set using procedural generation.
  - A deck has 3 factions with 12 cards in a deck
  - The rarities are:
    - Common - about 18 per deck - these establish the flavor of the set and faction
    - Uncommon - about 12 per deck - these give specific flavor to the deck
    - Rare - about 6 per deck - these are cards that do unique things
    - Legacy - about 6 per deck - these are cards from other sets
    - Maverick - about 3 per deck - these are cards from other factions
    - Legacy Mavericks - the odds of this are maverick crossed with legacy
- A card has a faction, name, rarity, type, traits, keywords, and abilities
- Factions:
  - Brobner: Board presence and large fighters that benefit from fighting
  - Dis: Destruction of creatures on both sides for benefit
  - Ekwidon: Exchange this for that, in their favor
  - Enlightened: Builds a board presence that works up to a big payoff and must be disrupted
  - Geistoid: Use the discard pile as a resource
  - Logos: Efficiency and card draw
  - Keyraken: Centered on large monsters that everything else revolves around
  - Mars: Insular benefits and synergy, at the expensive of friendly and enemy non-Martians
  - Ouboros: Stay exhausted for benefit and hoard aember
  - Redemption: Redeem the others houses - suck distortion
  - Sanctum: Protect the board and neighbors
  - Saurian: Risk reward by putting aember on the board for benefit
  - Shadows: Small but stealy
  - Skyborn: Care about board placement for benefit
  - Star Alliance: Cooperate with other factions for benefit

## Differences from KeyForge

- A refocus on the board over actions
- Cards with tradeoffs and being situational rather than just being good
- More upgrades can help boards be more dynamic and flexible
- Enhancements at this point are pretty flat. Instead, I want each card to know its traits (eg deals damage, gives ward, etc), and then have a distortion system where some cards give distortions to the deck, so that one card would get -1 of its trait, but that same trait would then be given +1 on a different card.
  - Maybe some distortions can change the traits being changed.
  - Distortions would be capped from +2 to -2
  - When a distortion takes so much that a trait would hit 0 or go negative, it turns into a softer trait:
    - 3 steal <-> 2 steal <-> 1 steal <-> capture 2 <-> capture 1
- Minimize simultaneous effects - things happen one at a time, reflecting the physical reality of the game.
- Not sure what to do with bonus icons. Distortion covers a lot of their ground, but having bonus aember still seems like a good thing.

## Keeping from KeyForge:

- Decide everything on your turn without interrupts
